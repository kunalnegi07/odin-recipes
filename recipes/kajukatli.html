    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Kaju Katli (or Kaju Barfi) is a popular, diamond-shaped Indian sweet made from a smooth paste of ground cashews, sugar, and sometimes milk/khoya, often flavored with cardamom and garnished with edible silver foil (vark). It's known for its melt-in-your-mouth texture, rich nutty flavor, and is a staple for Indian festivals, weddings, and celebrations, offering a luxurious treat that signifies joy and appreciation. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Core Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>

        <li><strong>Cashews (Kaju):</strong>Raw, unsalted cashews, ground into a fine powder without releasing oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>Granulated white sugar is best for the syrup.</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong>To create the sugar syrup.</li>
        <li><strong>Ghee (Clarified Butter): </strong> For greasing and adding richness. </li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>

        <li><strong>Powder the cashews:</strong>Grind fresh, room-temperature cashews into a fine powder using a mixer or food processor, pulsing in short bursts to prevent the release of oils which would turn it into a paste or butter. Sieve the powder to ensure it is fine and lump-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare sugar syrup:</strong>In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat sugar and water, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely. Continue cooking on a medium flame until the syrup reaches a one-string consistency (when a drop of syrup pulled between two fingers forms a single thread).</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the mixture:</strong>Reduce the heat to low, add the cashew powder and optional cardamom powder, and mix continuously. Stir the mixture until it thickens, forms a single lump, and starts to leave the sides of the pan. Be careful not to overcook, or the katli will turn hard.</li>        <li> Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool for a few minutes until it's warm enough to handle. Transfer it to a greased surface or parchment paper and knead gently with greased palms to form a smooth dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead and roll:</strong>Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool for a few minutes until it's warm enough to handle. Transfer it to a greased surface or parchment paper and knead gently with greased palms to form a smooth dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Flatten and cut:</strong>Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and roll it out with a rolling pin to the desired thickness (about 1/8 inch or 3-4 mm). If using, apply edible silver leaf (varq) on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Set and serve:</strong>Allow the rolled mixture to cool completely, then use a sharp, greased knife to cut it into traditional diamond shapes. Store the kaju katli in an airtight container. </li>
