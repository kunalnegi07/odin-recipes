    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Ras malai is a popular South Asian dessert consisting of soft, spongy cheese dumplings (malai) soaked in a sweetened, thickened, and cardamom-flavored milk sauce (ras). The name itself combines the Hindi words "ras" (juice/cream) and "malai" (cream). </p>

    </ul>
    
    <h3>For the Flavored Milk (Rabri)</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong>Whole milk, sometimes heavy cream or evaporated milk</li>
        <li><strong>Sweetener:</strong>Sugar, or condensed milk for instant versions.</li>

    <h2>Steps for making Ras malai</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Chhena:</strong>Boil full-fat milk, then curdle it with lemon juice or vinegar to separate the curds (chhena) from the whey.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Knead:</strong>Strain the chhena using a muslin cloth, rinse it with cold water, and squeeze out the excess water. Knead the moist chhena until it forms a smooth, soft dough with no cracks.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Discs:</strong>Divide the dough into small portions and roll them into balls. Gently flatten each ball into a disc shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook in Syrup:</strong>In a wide pan, bring a mixture of sugar and water to a rolling boil. Gently drop the chhena discs into the boiling syrup and cook for about 12-15 minutes, until they double in size.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Rabri:</strong>In a separate heavy-bottomed pan, boil milk and simmer it until it reduces to about half its original volume. Add sugar, cardamom powder, saffron, and chopped nuts (pistachios and almonds).</li>
        <li><strong>Combine and Chill:</strong>Take the cooked chhena discs out of the sugar syrup, gently squeeze out the excess syrup, and add them to the warm rabri. Let the ras malai cool completely, then refrigerate it for at least 4-6 hours or overnight for the best flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong>Garnish with additional chopped nuts and saffron strands before serving chilled. </li>
    </ol>
