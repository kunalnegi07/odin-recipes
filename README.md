# odin-recipes 
In this project I am building a simple website using HTML that displays different recipes .
It demonstrates basic HTML structure,links,lists,and images.
This project helped me practice writing clean HTML and using Git for version control.
After studying css for sometime I added css to the project too.

here is the demo - https://kunalnegi07.github.io/odin-recipes/
